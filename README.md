# Codex Web

An unofficial, self-hosted web workspace for the OpenAI Codex CLI. It adds persistent conversations and unsent drafts, file uploads and deliverables, server-side task queues, live steering, resumable interruption history, conversation archiving, automatic titles, adjustable reading size, light/dark/system appearance modes, and optional voice transcription.

> Codex Web is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by OpenAI.

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

## What it includes

- A responsive React chat interface for Codex CLI
- Server-persistent queued prompts with reorder, edit, delete, and steer actions
- Persistent attachments and generated deliverables
- Server-persistent unsent text, quotes, and attachments, restored across conversations, browsers, and devices
- Codex thread persistence across browser restarts
- Soft-deleted conversation audit records while workspace files are removed
- Archive and restore completed conversations without deleting their history or files
- Cancellation that retains a concise history of completed work so the next turn can resume from it
- Explicit interrupted-task messages after an unexpected service restart, without unsafe automatic retries
- Graceful container shutdown that drains in-flight Codex work and leaves queued tasks persisted
- Automatic short task titles, with manual titles taking precedence
- A durable live work journal with retained stage feedback and grouped command steps
- Running work journals expand inline with the page instead of creating a nested vertical scroller
- Unread-result markers for completed conversations until their detail is viewed
- Distinct running and queued indicators, plus a stable overflow menu for task actions
- A 500 MiB Codex rollout warning that suggests archiving very long conversations
- Light, dark, and system-following appearance modes
- Select message text and attach it as a removable, server-persisted reference to a new Agent question
- Load only the latest 30 messages initially, then fetch older pages at the top without moving the reader's position
- Optional Alibaba Cloud DashScope voice transcription
- Bounded transcription context from drafts, attachment names, text-file heads, recent messages, and a small number of images
- A fixed mobile app shell with inner scrolling for more reliable iPhone/iPad Safari behavior
- A dedicated Unix identity for the Codex worker inside the container
- A managed local spreadsheet skill backed by the pinned openpyxl/pandas runtime; detailed Excel rules are injected only for matching attachments
- Optional Apps, connectors, Goals, and multi-agent features remain off unless the conversation explicitly asks for them

## How the system fits together

Codex Web is the reusable, self-hosted core of a larger personal Agent workstation design. The core turns the Codex CLI into a durable web service: the browser can disappear, but conversations, drafts, queued prompts, attachments, progress events, thread IDs, and finished files remain on the server.

The full PP Agent deployment pattern adds a second execution tier for an administrator. Restricted member accounts still run inside isolated Docker tenants, while the administrator can route project work either to a trusted server-side executor or to a Remote Worker on another computer. This repository intentionally ships only the low-privilege public core as a safe default; the administrator host bridge, project mode, Remote Worker gateway, and production provisioning are extension components, not turnkey public settings.

### Roles and execution boundaries

| Role | Execution location | Accessible state | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Restricted member | Non-root tenant worker inside Docker | Its own conversations, library, uploads, outputs, and Codex Home | A friend or team member who should not access the host or another tenant |
| Public owner | The same isolated tenant model | Its own self-hosted workspace and service settings | The default single-owner setup in this repository |
| PP Agent administrator | Explicitly selected local or remote project executor | Projects the administrator has added, plus their retained task history | Managing trusted server projects and Codex sessions on connected computers |

    class router,hostBridge,gateway,hostCodex,remoteWorker,appServer,remoteState extensionNode;
```

The important boundary is the executor, not the browser account alone. A restricted account cannot turn a web request into host access: its job is validated, handed to a fixed Unix identity, and confined to that tenant's paths. Administrator project mode is a separate, explicit trust decision and is therefore kept out of the public default deployment.

### Remote computer execution

A Remote Worker does not expose an inbound shell, RDP endpoint, or generic tunnel. The current MVP initiates authenticated outbound long polling to the server, advertises its runtime capabilities, and executes only requests addressed to a registered project. Codex runs under the interactive user on that computer, with the real project directory as `cwd` and that user's normal Codex Home. The server stores the returned Codex thread ID so later turns in the same web conversation can resume it.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor A as Administrator
    participant API as PP Agent API
    participant G as Worker gateway
    participant W as Remote Worker
    participant C as Local codex app-server
    participant P as Remote project + Codex Home

    W->>G: Register, then open authenticated long polls
    A->>API: Open project and submit a task
    API->>API: Persist prompt and queue state
    API->>G: Dispatch to selected executor
    G->>W: Start or resume the project thread
    W->>C: Run with the project's real cwd
    C->>P: Read/write files and thread state
    C-->>W: Stream progress and final response
    W-->>G: Forward structured events
    G-->>API: Persist events, messages, and thread ID
    API-->>A: Live journal over SSE
```

The MVP does not import arbitrary desktop-created threads or synchronize a filesystem. Remote-generated files remain on that computer; only progress, the thread ID, and the final text response return to Codex Web. An offline selected project fails closed instead of running the task in a tenant workspace.

### Durable task lifecycle

The browser is a control surface, not the owner of task state. Drafts and their attachments are saved before submission; queued prompts can be edited, reordered, deleted, or converted into live steering. Different conversations may run concurrently, while each conversation remains serial. Progress is compacted into a bounded journal with important stage feedback retained; the journal grows with the main page and disappears when the final Agent response is stored.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Queued: submit
    Queued --> Queued: edit / reorder
    Queued --> Running: executor available
    Running --> Running: progress / steer
    Running --> Completed: final response persisted
    Running --> Cancelled: user stops task
    Cancelled --> Queued: continue from retained summary
    Completed --> Archived: archive
    Archived --> Completed: restore
    Completed --> [*]
```

This architecture separates four kinds of durable state:

- application state in SQLite: identities, sessions, conversations, messages, drafts, jobs, events, ordering, and thread references;
- tenant knowledge and files: each user's library, uploads, outputs, and immutable deliverables;
- Codex state: login credentials and thread history inside the executor's own Codex Home;
- runtime state: short-lived per-job directories and processes that can be reconstructed after a restart.

For the public build, the web process has no Docker socket, host filesystem mount, or root bridge. See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) before adapting the extension pattern to your own environment.

## Requirements

- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2
- At least 4 GB RAM; 8 GB is recommended for document-heavy tasks
- A Codex account that can sign in through the Codex CLI
- Node.js 22+ only if you want to run the test suite or password helper locally

## Quick start

1. Copy the configuration template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example app.env
   ```

2. Install development dependencies and generate a password hash:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run hash-password -- 'choose-a-long-unique-password'
   ```

3. Put the generated hash in `APP_PASSWORD_HASH`, set a random `SESSION_SECRET` of at least 32 characters, and adjust `APP_USERNAME` and `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` in `app.env`.

   Docker Compose automatically parses a file named `.env`, including `$` characters in bcrypt hashes. Keeping application secrets in `app.env` prevents those values from being interpolated or echoed as Compose warnings. Use `.env` only for optional Compose settings such as `CODEX_WEB_PORT`, `CODEX_WEB_MEMORY_LIMIT`, `CODEX_WEB_CPU_LIMIT`, and `TZ`.

   On a Linux production host, keep the file readable only by root and the fixed web-process group: `sudo chown root:10001 app.env && sudo chmod 0640 app.env`. Docker Desktop users can keep the platform-managed file permissions.

4. Build and start the service:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

5. Sign the isolated owner worker into Codex:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec --user 11001:11001 \
     -e HOME=/app/tenants/00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001 \
     -e CODEX_HOME=/app/tenants/00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001/codex-home \
     app codex login --device-auth
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:37821/codex-web/](http://localhost:37821/codex-web/).

State is stored in Docker named volumes. Closing the browser does not remove queued work, attachments, unsent composer drafts, or archived conversations.

For private mobile access, start with Tailscale Serve so HTTPS is available only inside the tailnet while the container port remains loopback-only. A later move to a public domain changes only the reverse proxy and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; volumes, sessions, and Remote Worker project mappings remain intact. See the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Optional voice transcription

Set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and an HTTPS `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `app.env` to enable the microphone button. The default model is `qwen3.5-omni-plus`; you can override it with `DASHSCOPE_ASR_MODEL`. Microphone access requires a secure browser context.

Audio is uploaded to your server first and then sent to the DashScope endpoint configured by `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`. Leave the key empty to disable the feature completely.

The optional spelling/topic context is bounded to about 500 tokens by default and shared across the draft, attachment names, the first 16 KiB of text attachments, recent messages, fixed technical terms, and up to two small images. Large unsent files are never copied wholesale into the transcription request. Tune the limits with `TRANSCRIPTION_CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET`, `TRANSCRIPTION_CONTEXT_MAX_IMAGES`, and `TRANSCRIPTION_CONTEXT_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`.

## Reverse proxy

The container binds to loopback by default. Proxy `/codex-web/` to `http://127.0.0.1:37821/codex-web/` and preserve WebSocket/SSE-friendly buffering settings. See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run dev
```

The default development URL is `http://127.0.0.1:5173/codex-web/`.

## Security model

Codex runs as a dedicated non-root Unix user. The web process can coordinate that worker through a local supervisor but the public edition has no Docker socket, no host filesystem bridge, and no host-root execution path. Review [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) before exposing an instance to the internet.
